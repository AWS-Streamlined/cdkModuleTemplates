# CDK Module Templates

This repository contains CDK modules that are easy to copy and substitute in real applications. All the modules can be found under the [cdkModules](./cdkModules/) directory.

There are also a few common runbooks and README files under the [docs](./docs/) directory. They are common enough to be reused in other projects.
